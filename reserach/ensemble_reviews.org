* Reviewer 7H9e
  Weak Reject
** Strengths
*** Good experimental results on combined dataset
*** Method is simple yet effective to combine different models and datasets
** Weaknesses
*** Limited impact of results
    These results are not surprising in the literature since ensembles are well-known in the literature
*** Most diversity comes from different datasets which makes the ensemble training easy
*** Would be interesting to add a 3rd dataset to examine performance on completely novel objects
** Proposed Response
*** Although ensemble methods are well-studied, few have attempted to apply them to grasping
*** This allows us to see if they are viable with the current pool of state-of-the-art networks
*** Allows us to see if the performance gain is worth the trouble
*** Allows us to make inference on how to further improve the state-of-the-art (more datasets)
*** Adding another dataset may take some time depending on how difficult acquiring and evaluating on it is
* Reviewer dhCr
  Weak Accept
** Strengths
*** Evaluating how much we could benefit by combining methods/datasets is interesting
** Weaknesses
*** Method is designed for grasping, but ensembling is applicable to other domains, where it is less novel
*** Evaluation on unseen datasets is important as mentioned in the limitation section
*** Clarification on the benefits of combining diff methods vs diff datasets would be nice
** Proposed Response
*** Novelty complaints are similar to the ones by Reviewer 7H9e, response may be similar
*** Unseen datasets (having a 3rd dataset) is again similar to the minor point added by Reviewer 7H9e
*** TODO Can easily add clarification on the benefits of methods vs datasets for diversity
* Reviewer W7kz
  Weak Reject
** Strengths
*** Using ensembles to predict grasp quality is underexplored and shows strong performance improvements
** Weaknesses
*** No direct connection to robotics (real world/simulated experiments)
    Rely on dataset performance is not good enough
*** No citations to other highly relevant works
    Mainly discusses lack of citations to 6dof grasping algorithm papers
*** State-of-the-art grasping is already working on 6D grasps, this is too simple
*** Add comment on the additional computational overhead (e.g. time of execution)
*** Evaluation of the algorithm on 6D grasping datasets like ACRONYM to compare to 6D algorithms
*** Missing details on how to train the ensemble network
** Proposed Response
*** TODO Can maybe run some simulation experiments, but it will be quite time consuming
*** TODO We can add a section in the related work to discuss 6D grasps
*** Although new algorithms are 6D, planar methods are still widely applicable
    In some settings they may perform better (need to check)
*** Difficult to evaluate on 6D datasets without heavy pre-processing of the data, but doable
*** TODO Add details on training ensemble network
* Reviewer QSn3
  Strong Reject
** Strengths
*** Technical details present clearly
*** Diversity metric study is interesting
*** Ablation study is great
** Weaknesses
*** It is unclear how generalization is tested, real experiments or a third dataset helps
    Although it was included in the limitations section, it is quite important to have
*** Novelty is a bit unclear
    Although ensemble applied to grasping is new, the technical innovation is marginal
*** Comparison is a bit unfair since experts are trained on individual datasets but ensemble uses all
    Would be better to train experts on all datasets as well to compare vs ensemble
*** Explain the output of the angles better (it is produced as cos and sin)
*** What is the individual test-set performance of experts?
*** It is worth it to examine how the IoU metric would correlate with a grasp accuracy increase
*** It would be helpful to see more fair evaluation of the ensemble method
    Basically trying to say that we need better illustration of the effect of IoU
** Proposed Response
*** Generalization complaints are similar to what other reviewers mentioned
*** Novelty can be explained similar to the response to Reviewer 7H9e
*** TODO Comparison can be clarified by training experts on all datasets to show
*** TODO Can add additional explanation for output
*** Mention that we are the first people discussing the relevance of IoU
